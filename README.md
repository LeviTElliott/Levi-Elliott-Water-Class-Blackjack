//Goal of the Game
The Goal is to have your player’s card count total at or as close to “21” as possible. In the end, the participant (dealer included) with the highest “total” under 21 wins the round.


// steps taken during rounds
Step one: Players place wager

Step two: Dealer deals cards. 1 card face up, to each player, one card face down to self, another card face up to each player, one card face up to self. Players can see 2 cards of each player, and only 1 of the dealer’s cards

Step Three: players play their hands (from left to right).

Player options post deal:

stand - call it after 2 cards

split - split a pair of cards with the same values (including K &q or J& K etc)

hit - take another card

double down - take only 1 additional card, but double your bet. no further additions allowed.

surrender - folding, but allows you half your original bet back.


//outlying conditionals 
conditionals:

If a player or the dealer has a “blackjack” (a face card and an ace equating to 21 on their first two cards) the round ends immidiately.

a tie between player and dealer is a “push.” Player recieves their original bet back but with no winnings.

If all players “bust” the dealer automatically wins & vice versus.
